# Asynchronous/Synchronous

Are two ways of execute some code

## Synchronous

A synchronous code means that it's executed instruction by instruction where one instruction need to wait until the previous instruction finish its execution.

## Asynchronous

An asynchronous code means that all instructions will be executed but not necessarily one instruction need to wait until previous instruction finish its execution.

# Setup example
